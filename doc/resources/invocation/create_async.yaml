  summary: Create a new asynchronous invocation job.
  description: |
    This endpoint allows an agent user to create a new asynchronous invocation job.
    The job is added to a queue and will be processed by the next available agent.

    Key features:
    - Asynchronous execution: The endpoint returns immediately with an invocation ID.
    - Job queuing: The invocation is queued for processing by available agents.
    - Status tracking: The returned invocation ID can be used to query the job's status and results.

    Usage flow:
    1. Submit the invocation job using this endpoint.
    2. Receive an immediate response with the invocation ID.
    3. Use the invocation ID to check the job's status and retrieve results by calling:
       GET /v1/invocations/{id}

    Note:
    - This endpoint is designed for non-blocking operations where immediate results are not required.
    - The status and results of the invocation can be queried using the /v1/invocations/{id} endpoint,
      where {id} is the invocation ID returned by this POST request.
