  summary: Create a new synchronous invocation job
  description: |
    This endpoint allows an agent user to create and execute a new invocation job synchronously.
    The request will wait for the job to complete before returning the result.

    Key features:
    - Synchronous execution: The endpoint waits for the job to finish before responding.
    - Immediate results: The response includes the complete result of the invocation.
    - Blocking operation: This call may take some time to complete, depending on the job's complexity.

    Usage flow:
    1. Submit the invocation job using this endpoint.
    2. The agent retrieves and processes the job.
    3. Once the job is completed, the endpoint returns with the full result.

    Response includes:
    - Invocation ID
    - Job status (which should be 'completed' unless an error occurred)
    - Full result data or error details

    Note: This endpoint is suitable for operations where immediate results are required and
    the client can wait for the job to complete. For long-running tasks, consider using
    the asynchronous version of this endpoint to avoid timeout issues.

    Caution: Depending on the nature of the invocation job, this endpoint may have
    longer response times. Set client timeouts accordingly.
