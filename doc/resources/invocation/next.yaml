  summary: Retrieve the next available invocation job for processing
  description: |
    This endpoint is used by agents to fetch the next available invocation job.
    It allows agents to retrieve jobs for processing.

    Key features:
    - State transition: Upon successful retrieval, the job state changes from 'available' to 'running'.
    - Exclusive access: Once a job is retrieved, it's locked for the assigned agent to prevent duplicate processing.

    Note:
    - If no jobs are available, a 404 status is returned.
    - Agents should implement appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms.
