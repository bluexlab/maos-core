  parameter:
    type: object
    properties:
      nlist:
        type: integer
        description: Number of cluster units
      nfactors:
        type: integer
        description: Number of factors of product quantization
      M:
        type: integer
        description:
          M defines tha maximum number of outgoing connections in the graph.
          Higher M leads to higher accuracy/run_time at fixed ef/efConstruction. Required when index type is *HNSW*.
      efConstruction:
        type: integer
        description:
          ef_construction controls index search speed/build speed tradeoff. Increasing the efConstruction parameter
          may enhance index quality, but it also tends to lengthen the indexing time.
          Required when index type is *HNSW*.
      drop_ratio_build:
        type: number
        minimum: 0
        maximum: 1
        description:
          The proportion of small vector values that are excluded during the indexing process.
          This option allows fine-tuning of the indexing process, making a trade-off between efficiency
          and accuracy by disregarding small values when building the index.
          It's required when index type is *SPARSE_INVERTED_INDEX* or *SPARSE_WAND*.
